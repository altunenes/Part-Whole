# Update for Media Pipe

Since dlib library is getting older, I edited main code and apply with the Media Pipe library. It's faster than dlib but I don't think it giving better results. I  added faces that are processed with media pipe, so try both; and use the best result :)

# Part-Whole
Swap facial landmarks for the part-whole task 

The part-whole task is a well-known task among face researchers especially studying face processing. It has been developed by  (Tanaka & Farah, 1993) https://doi.org/10.1080/14640749308401045.

This script provides you a realistic results with seamlessClone function. 

In order to get clear results, use high-quality images as much as possible. But if you have low-quality faces you probably need to use some extra filter methods to edges (Gaussian is working well in most scenarios).
